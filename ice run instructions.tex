\begin{enumerate}
  \item Either MUG or one of the shift members will have the cash pouch, which holds the cash needed to buy the ice.
  \item Arrive on shift around 12:00pm, and find the megaphone and wagons. Call 'Ice Run' on the megaphone, and give the camp 5 minutes to get the last orders in. If people need to change/cancel pre-orders, refer to the spreadsheet for instructions.
  \item Grab the clipboard and bike wagon, and get in line at the 9 o'clock Arctica. While in line, count up the the bags of crushed and block ice needed. Get the needed cash ready, or be prepared to pay via Apple Pay or credit card.
  \item Get back to camp, announce that you guys are back on the megaphone, and deliver the ice to the coolers for any \emph{absent/occupied} camp members. Put fulfilled ice vouchers in the cash change pouch, cross off that day's preorders on the spreadsheet.
  \item Designate someone to hand off the cash pouch to someone on the next shift.
\end{enumerate}
